Looping over dictionaries
This page is a summary of some different ways to loop over a dictionary.
If you have a dictionary:
favorites = {
'color': 'purple',
'number': 42,
'animal': 'turtle',
'language': 'python'
}
You can loop over the keys, the values, or the entries, as shown below ...
 Keys
By default, Python will loop over the keys in the dictionary:
for key in favorites:
 print(key)
Or you can use the keys method, which will do the same thing:
for key in favorites.keys():
 print(key)
In both cases, the output will be:
color
number
animal
language
 Values
To loop over the values, use the values method.
for value in favorites.values():
 print(value)
This will print:
version 1.0
purple
42
turtle
python
 Entries
To loop over the entries, use the items method.
for entry in favorites.items():
 print(entry)
This will print a tuple for each entry:
('color', 'purple')
('number', 42)
('animal', 'turtle')
('language', 'python')
When looping over the entries, you can also assign the key and value to their own separate variables:
for key, value in favorites.items():
 print(f"my favorite {key} is {value}")
This will print:
my favorite color is purple
my favorite number is 42
my favorite animal is turtle
my favorite language is python
